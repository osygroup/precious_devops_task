# Precious DevOps Task
## Part II: Deliver Small App for K8S and a Helm Chart

This repository contains the following:
A simple Python HTTP app that upon query returns the contents of the Azure Blob Storage container in JSON format.
A Dockerfile for creation of a Docker image for the Python app
A Helm chart for the Python app
A workflow (update_helm_repo.yml) file for updating the Helm chart on the created Azure Storage Helm repository
A workflow (deploy_to_AKS.yml) file for building the Docker image, pushing it to Azure Container Registry, and installing the Python app Helm chart on AKS.

Helm is the de facto package manager for Kubernetes and a chart is a collection of templates powered by a template engine that easily describes your Kubernetes manifest YAML files. Essentially Helm enables you to streamline your Kubernetes deployments by allowing you to use variables instead of hard-code values.


Create your Storage Account and container via Azure CLI, Terraform, or Azure Portal. 

```
mkdir chart-demo && cd chart-demo

helm create pythonapp_chart

helm lint pythonapp_chart

helm package pythonapp_chart

helm repo index --url https://helmdemo.blob.core.windows.net/helmdemo/ .
```

The 'helm package' command will create a tgz packaging of the chart
The 'helm repo index' command will create an index.yaml file in your working directory

Upload both files to the Azure Storage container (blob):

az storage blob upload --container-name $containerName --file index.yaml --name index.yaml --account-name $storageAccountName --account-key $storageAccountKey

az storage blob upload --container-name $containerName --file pythonapp_chart-0.1.0.tgz --name pythonapp_chart-0.1.0.tgz --account-name $storageAccountName --account-key $storageAccountKey


At some point, you will want to upload additional charts. For each new chart, youâ€™ll need to regenerate the index.yaml file. You can use the command helm repo index --url to rebuild your index.yaml, this will rebuild it from scratch and by default will only include the charts found locally. 
So ensure that you are creating your new charts in the same directory with others, so that the index.yaml file will capture all the charts. If you create a new chart in a different directory, the index.yaml file that will be generated will only capture that new chart. Uploading this file on the Azure storage container (the private Helm repository) will overwrite whatever index.yaml file that is already there and render the earlier uploaded packaged charts useless. A local update of Helm repos will remove the charts.

Add the helm repository to your local:
To add a Helm repo to your local:
helm repo add helm_repo_azure https://helmdemo.blob.core.windows.net/helmdemo/

List all the repositories on your local:
helm repo list

Update all the helm repositories on your local:
helm repo update

To search the Helm repositories on your local for a chart (using a keyword):
helm search repo pythonapp

View all the helm releases in the cluster:
helm list --all-namespaces

Port-forward the python app on your local (port 8099 in this case) to view the app:
kubectl port-forward -n pythonapp service/pythonapp 8099:5000
